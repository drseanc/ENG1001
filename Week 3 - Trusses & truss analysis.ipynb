    "\n",
    "Trusses are one of the first *complete structures* we'll tackle. There is a couple of reasons for this; firstly, the truss is a very simple structure, easy to understand and analyse. Through some simple mechanics (that you've covered in week 1 and 2) we can quite easily trace the **load path** through a truss and visualise how forces are being transmitted through the structure and back to it's supports.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other reason we introduce trusses now is because they are so ubiquitous. We see them all around the built environment. Their simplicity belies their exceptional ability to span very large distances with great efficiency. It's this efficiency that makes them well suited as roof and bridge structures. "

    "A truss is a structure that consists of a collection of elements connected at **pin joints or nodes**. In theory, the pin joints provide no rotational resistance and behave as hinges. The benefit of a truss is that the members are predominantly axially loaded. This means they are either in compression, tension or have no force, so-called zero force members. This makes trusses a particularly efficient structural form. This is evidenced by the fact that we see truss structures routinely employed to span large distances and efficiently withstand high loads."

As such, moments cannot be transmitted from one member into adjacent members. Only forces can be transmitted through nodes. From the engineering perspective, a truss, like any structure has one purpose, to transmit externally applied forces through the structure and back into the supports or foundations of that structure. Take the simplest form of truss as an example."

Common forms or patterns of truss have emerged in response to different use cases. Some of the most common are the **Pratt, Howe, Warren and Modified Warren**.\n",

The diagonal members are arranged so that they only develop tensile forces. The vertical members in a Pratt truss develop compression forces. This means they will typically be more robust and capable of resisting buckling. "

As a result, in response to vertical or gravity loading, the vertical members typically go into tension with the diagonal members going into compression. This is slightly less advantageous than the Pratt truss configuration as the longer diagonal members must now resist buckling in compression.  "

This is also particularly helpful when the truss must support *secondary structure* such as roof purlins for example. One important condition to observe when designing a truss is to ensure any external loading is applied at a nodal point. The vertical members in a modified Warren truss help to facilitate this. "

    "Recall when we discussed supports models in week 2. We said that roller, pin and cantilever supports were simply idealised models of real foundation/support behaviour. Well the exact same thing is true of the truss models we analyse. When we set about analysing a truss we first have to construct a model on which to base our analysis. We must remember that the model is an imperfect representation of the real world structure. It's our approximation of the actual structure and will almost never capture 100\\% of the detail of the real-world structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes these differences between model and structure are quite small, in which case we can have more confidence in our analysis. However if we're not careful the simplifying assumptions that facilitate our analysis can be so limiting that the model behaviour is not a good representation of the structure. Having an appreciation for the impact of how your assumptions degrade the accuracy of your model is crucially important.   \n",
    "\n",
    "So, what assumptions apply to the analysis of trusses? The first one has already been mentioned; we assume that the nodes or joints that connect members behave as pins. In other words, if we consider two members meeting at a joint, they would be free to rotate relative to each other. Now, as we've said, the implication of this is that no bending moments can be transmitted through a joint, only force. \n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to the second assumption; the members within a truss are subject to axial loads only, tension, compression or no force. Provided all external loads are applied at joints, then no bending will be induced within any of the members. Of course if an external force was applied to a member between joints, stresses due to bending would be induced in that member, but we typical try to avoid this *'inter-nodal'* loading in trusses if possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "The obvious question is how valid are these assumptions? Well, regarding the pinned joints, in reality true pins allowing free rotation are very rarely provided. This is mainly driven by the relatively high cost of fabricating such joints. In a steel truss, the joints are almost always bolted or welded. As such, bending moments will be transmitted to some degree through joints and therefore within the structure. "

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "However, the geometry of the joints is usually such that their ability to transmit moment is quite limited. So our assumption usually causes model behaviour to deviate relatively little from the actual structural behaviour. With reference to the members developing only axial loads, it follows from our discussion of joints, that if inter-nodal loading is minimised, the predominant action experienced by the members will be axial force. So, all-in-all our truss models are pretty reasonable approximations of real truss structures."
